A fulltime Linux user is looking for opportunities in Back-End, SysAdmin, or DevOps. 

I usually use Python, Go, PHP, and Bash. Now I want to spend more time with Rust, Ruby, and Node.JS. 

I recently spend most of my free time contribute pull request on GitHub. I also spend time, and host my files, on Gitlab. You can find me [here](https://gitlab.com/sonarypt).
